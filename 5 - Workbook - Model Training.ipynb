    "2. Then, freely experiment with and explore any interesting or confusing concepts. Simply insert new code cells and then use the help of Google and official documentation.\n",
    "3. Finally, tackle all of the exercises at the end. They will help you tie everything together and **learn in context.**\n",

    "Similar to how we created dictionaries for our pipelines and hyperparameter grids, we can do the same for our fitted models. Obviously, there are other valid ways to organize your code and models, but this is a simple and practical way that does the job. By the end of the script, you'll have various dictionary objects that can each be accessed by the same consistent keys.\n",

    "#### A.) Create a dictionary of models named <code style=\"color:SteelBlue\">fitted_models</code> to store models that have been tuned using cross-validation.\n",
    "* The keys should be the same as those in the <code style=\"color:SteelBlue\">pipelines</code> and <code style=\"color:SteelBlue\">hyperparameters</code> dictionaries. \n",
    "* The values should be <code style=\"color:steelblue\">GridSearchCV</code> objects that have been fitted to <code style=\"color:steelblue\">X_train</code> and <code style=\"color:steelblue\">y_train</code>.\n",
